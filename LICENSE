The changes I've made to these mods are minor, but crucial to dealing
with an all-underground environment. The mobs don't have vertical
range limits, are less affected by light, and they behave a bit
differently from the originals.



The code for V6 and massive caves was taken from the Minetest code,
distributed under the LGPL 2.1 license, and so is my original code from
this project (so as to comply with GPL requirements).
