# fun_caves

Fun Caves is an attempt to convert the mapgen V6 caves into a lua mod, so they can be used with any mapgen. I've translated the C++ code into lua in the most mechanical way possible. I honestly have no idea how half of it works, and I don't intend to spend a lot of time on it in the future, so anyone who likes this mod is encouraged to fork and/or tinker with it and submit pull requests.
