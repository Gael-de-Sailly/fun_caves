# fun_caves

Fun Caves started as an attempt to convert the mapgen V6 caves into a lua mod, so they could be used with any mapgen. However, I've since turned it into an all cave environment, with no surface at all.

Players spawn into a massive cave, hopefully in an area with mushrooms, and start digging. Dig up, dig down, dig sideways, you'll never find a surface world -- no trees, no flowers, no cows and horses. What you will find are fungi, algae, monsters, and lots and lots of goblins. Every ore is available, everywhere, which means there's a lot of it.

Hint: Find some giant mushrooms, first thing. They're handy.
