# fun_caves

Fun Caves started as an attempt to convert the mapgen V6 caves into a lua mod, so they could be used with any mapgen. Then I turned it into an all cave environment, with no surface at all. Now it's just a more extensive underworld, with biomes owing much to caverealms. Once you go underground, you should find everything you need to survive without ever returning to the surface.

The surface has some neat extras such as coral, water plants, extra desert resources (deserts are hard). You'll also find big dungeon mazes underground, which will (soon) be replete with monsters and traps (though just finding your way through them is exhausting enough). There will be a little treasure, but the main goal is to retrieve a full set of trophy items for bragging rights.
